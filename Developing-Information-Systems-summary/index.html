<h4 id="what-is-systems-development">What is Systems Development?</h4>

<p>Systems development is the structured process by which business requirements are converted into an operational IT system. The development process often involves multiple stages, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A feasibility study to evaluate if the project is worth pursuing.</li>
  <li>Requirements engineering to analyze business needs and specify user requirements.</li>
  <li>System design to cater to user needs.</li>
  <li>Software development to meet those needs.</li>
  <li>Testing of the developed software.</li>
  <li>Implementation of the solution.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="evolving-nature-of-systems-development">Evolving Nature of Systems Development</h4>

<p>Previously, systems development was more ad hoc and reliant on the skill and enthusiasm of individual developers. However, due to the increased significance of IT systems in organizations today, more structured processes have been introduced to mitigate risks and manage the complexity of systems.</p>

<h4 id="relation-to-other-disciplines">Relation to Other Disciplines</h4>

<p>Systems development is not an isolated function; it intertwines with several other disciplines, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Project Management</strong>: Ensures proper planning and resource allocation for the development process.</li>
  <li><strong>Business Analysis</strong>: Focuses on understanding business issues and opportunities that the IT system aims to address.</li>
  <li><strong>Systems Architecture</strong>: Concerned with building a foundational blueprint for systems.</li>
  <li><strong>Testing</strong>: A specialized discipline that aims to identify defects and assure system quality.</li>
  <li><strong>Configuration Management and Change Control</strong>: Deals with managing system components and their relationships, and controlling changes in a structured manner.</li>
  <li><strong>Quality Control and Assurance</strong>: Ensures that the system meets defined quality criteria.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="offshoring-and-outsourcing">Offshoring and Outsourcing</h4>

<p>Many organizations offshore or outsource their systems development. Offshoring is usually done to capitalize on cheaper, high-quality resources in other countries, such as India. Outsourcing is the practice of delegating development work to specialized IT firms, which might also be coupled with offshoring. These practices come with their own sets of advantages and challenges, such as communication barriers and loss of control over critical systems.</p>

<p>By understanding these facets of systems development, organizations can better manage the complexities and challenges that come with building IT systems.</p>
